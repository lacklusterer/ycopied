                    <p>After spending the last five years building and scaling web applications from startup MVP to enterprise-level systems serving millions of users, I've learned some hard lessons about what works and what doesn't when it comes to scalability.</p>

                    <h2>The Database Bottleneck</h2>
                    <p>The most common mistake I see teams make is treating their database as an infinite resource. When you're serving 100 users, a poorly optimized query might add 50ms to your response time. When you're serving 100,000 users, that same query can bring your entire system to its knees.</p>

                    <p>Here are the key principles I follow:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Index everything you query</strong> - This seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how many production systems have queries scanning entire tables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement read replicas early</strong> - Don't wait until you need them. The architectural complexity is worth it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cache aggressively</strong> - Redis became our best friend. Cache database queries, API responses, even HTML fragments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Frontend Performance Trap</h2>
                    <p>Modern JavaScript frameworks make it easy to build complex UIs, but they also make it easy to ship bloated, slow applications. We learned this the hard way when our bundle size grew to 2MB and our mobile users started complaining.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Performance is a feature, not an afterthought."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Some practical steps we took:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented code splitting at the route level</li>
                        <li>Used service workers for aggressive caching</li>
                        <li>Optimized images with WebP and progressive loading</li>
                        <li>Measured real user metrics, not just synthetic tests</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Monitoring Revolution</h3>
                    <p>You can't optimize what you don't measure. We spent way too long flying blind before implementing proper monitoring. Now we track everything:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Application performance metrics</li>
                        <li>Database query performance</li>
                        <li>Real user monitoring (RUM)</li>
                        <li>Business metrics tied to performance</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Lessons for the Future</h2>
                    <p>The biggest lesson? <strong>Plan for scale from day one, but don't over-engineer.</strong> There's a fine balance between building something that can grow and building something so complex that it never ships.</p>

                    <p>Start simple, measure everything, and optimize based on real data, not assumptions. Your users will thank you, and your future self will too.</p>
